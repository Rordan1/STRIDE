Our top priorities are to protect our customer's personal and financial data, secure our transactions processing systems, and ensure the availability and integrity of our online banking services.

## System Architect
Certainly. Our online banking platform leverages several AWS services to support its functionality. We utilize Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), RDS (Relational Database Service), and Amazon S3.

RDS (Relational Database Service)
Amazon S3

We also plan to use Elastic Load Balancer to handle traffic distribution, but thatâ€™s still in the works.

We utilize Amazon S3 for storing static assets and files, such as customer profile pictures and document uploads, EC2 for hosting microservices via Virtual Machines, and RDS for storing customer data.

## Lead Developer
Sure thing! The main features of our platform include secure user registration and authentication, account management, fund transfers, bill payments, and account statements. We also offer a mobile app for convenient access to our services.

## Security Engineer
Absolutely, there are a number of threats we should consider. First, external attackers can try to break into our system via different methods such as brute-force attacks, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or distributed denial of service (DDoS). In addition, insecure AWS configurations, such as exposed public buckets and RDS endpoints, may incur potential risks.
